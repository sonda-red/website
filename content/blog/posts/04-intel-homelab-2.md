In the first part of this series, I walked through the hardware choices and the initial setup of my Intel-powered homelab. With the machines successfully doing their best to keep optimal temps this summer, it was time to document the first big step - building up the cluster.

## 00 Philosophy: Get to Kubernetes fast and dirty, because I want to run some damned AI finally!

Not too dirty though...

In previous homelab builds I spent weeks on setting up complex home networks, PXE booting, HA experiments with external datastores, etc. An important lesson is that your project needs to have a priority and learning goal, otherwise you can get lost in making the most balanced, perfect, and future-proof setup. So forgive the ignored best practices of some aspects of this setup. The focus is of course running AI workloads on Intel Arc GPUs, For now, I avoided using an ephemeral cluster I bring up and destroy locally, like `kind` but that may change. So this is a mix of both worlds, not a perfect 3-master HA cluster with all the bells and whistles, but also not cluster running locally.

### Flux and GitOps

I've used `helmfile` with a pipeline setup in `Gitlab` for my previous homelab and use `ArgoCD` at work. `Flux` is a bit different but I like it for its pure GitOps approach. I'm a bit tired of clicking, to be honest. I don't want to click around in a UI, or follow pipelines along. I want to commit like a mad man and after a while have my changes propagated to the cluster. In theory, ArgoCD can do that too but there's something about the way you write the argo manifests that doesn't feel as clean as Flux. Don't treat this as a valid technical argument, it's just a personal preference. I also had a fun talk with a colleague once about the differences and this was his take:

> I've been working in 3 companies in a row, first one was using helmfile, second - argo, and third - flux
And in the first one we were just getting things done with k8s and having fun with other tasks, like we were working on an open source project, or trying complicated setups and different tools. But in the rest we were mostly trying to make GitOps work, re-writing manifests because of YAML typos, reviewing something like 700 lines of YAML code, merging, fixing, and trying to make GitOps work again. 

Hopefully this cluster won't grow to the extent that I have to deal with that :)

But yeah, the biggest time waster was following the logs of the Flux helm controller, trying to figure out why it didn't apply the changes I made, redoing the changes, manually reconciling, etc. Dealing with all the different ways the helm charts of the tools organize their values is one of the reasons I'm becoming skeptical of helm recently. Also, using the Flux configMap and secret generators and integrating them with SOPS was a bit of a pain. However, when all the pieces fell into place and made a sound template, it was just a matter of replicating the same pattern for the rest of the cluster components.

## 01 Day 0: k3s no bs

I stripped k3s of the pieces I’d replace anyway — flannel, kube‑proxy, traefik. I love `cilium` because of its alien eBPF magic I don't quite understand, the visibility and the node firewall rules it gives me so that's the CNI, end of story. Everything was run manually with a set of simple scripts. This is one of those compromises I mentioned earlier.

Control Plane:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - server \
  --token {token} \
  --cluster-init \
  --flannel-backend=none \
  --disable-kube-proxy \
  --disable servicelb \
  --disable-network-policy \
  --disable traefik \
  --tls-san=sondas \
  --tls-san=sonda-01 \
  --tls-san=sonda-02 \
  --tls-san=sonda-core \
  --tls-san=127.0.0.1 \
  --kube-apiserver-arg=kubelet-preferred-address-types=InternalIP,ExternalIP,Hostname
```

Workers joined with:

```bash
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -s - agent \
  --token {token} \
  --server https://sonda-01:6443
```

I kept both the NUC and the GPU box as workers and only later differentiated them with taints.

## 02 Software updates

---

> Disclaimer: No automation regarding OS package installation or upgrading.
> * Host packages and kernel updates are just a manual `dnf upgrade` about once a month too - as well as OS upgrades, whenever a new Fedora Release comes out.

[![Node upgrade](/images/post-04/node-upgrade.png)](/images/post-04/node-upgrade.png)

---

## 03 Storage layout

* **NUC nodes:** single 512 GB disk given entirely to k3s.
* **GPU node:** 2 TB NVMe for k3s data, 512 GB for the OS, and a separate 2 TB scratch disk for local experiments.

---

## 04 Intel GPU support: the bare minimum

On the **GPU node only** I enabled Intel’s oneAPI repo and installed the base bits so containers would see Level Zero and friends. The operator doesn’t install drivers; hosts must be ready beforehand.

```bash
# Enable Intel oneAPI repo and install base packages
sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/oneAPI.repo >/dev/null <<'EOF'
[oneAPI]
name=Intel oneAPI repository
baseurl=https://yum.repos.intel.com/oneapi
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB
EOF
sudo dnf -y install intel-basekit intel-oneapi-runtime-libs
```

Installing the `intel-basekit`, `intel-level-zero` and the `SYCL` packages will result in a system that supports the Intel Arc GPUs and the Level Zero API.

This support is later extended in Kubernetes with the `intel-device-operator` and `intel-device-plugins-gpu` to expose the GPUs to the cluster, which you can follow in the next section at [Intel GPU specifics on k8s level](#intel-gpu-specifics).

* Sanity Test:
To make sure everything is working at this stage, I usually go through [the process of pulling an ipex image](https://pytorch-extension.intel.com/installation?platform=gpu&version=v2.7.10%2Bxpu&os=linux%2Fwsl2&package=docker), which stands for [intel-extension-for-pytorch](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch).


> You can run a simple sanity test to double confirm if the correct version is installed, and if the software stack can get correct hardware information onboard your system. The command should return PyTorch* and Intel® Extension for PyTorch* versions installed, as well as GPU card(s) information detected.

```bash
# Pull the image and run a simple test to check if the Intel Extension for PyTorch is working correctly
docker pull intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch:2.7.10-xpu
# Run the test in the container while giving it access to the GPU devices
docker run --rm -it --device /dev/dri intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch:2.7.10-xpu \
  python -c "import torch; import intel_extension_for_pytorch as ipex; print(torch.__version__); print(ipex.__version__); [print(f'[{i}]: {torch.xpu.get_device_properties(i)}') for i in range(torch.xpu.device_count())];"

```

Output should look like this, with the GPU name and properties printed. Congrats, you can be sure that the Intel Extension for PyTorch is working correctly and can access the GPU devices, otherwise you'll receive something of the likes of XPU device not found or similar.

## 05 TLS: a local CA for now

I didn’t want public ACME in the lab. I minted a self‑signed root inside the cluster and used a CA `ClusterIssuer` for leaf certs. Trust is me installing the root CA on my devices, for the flex of having https on my ingress

Manifests were deployed at boostrapping the cluster: [bootstrap/infra/cert-manager/kustomization/root-ca.yaml](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/tree/main/bootstrap/infra/cert-manager/kustomization/root-ca.yaml).

## 06 Secrets: SOPS, encrypted in Git

I keep secrets **in the repo** but encrypted with SOPS (age). Flux decrypts at apply time, so I get Git history without leaking credentials. Policy lives at the root: [.sops.yaml](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/blob/main/.sops.yaml). I encrypt per‑app secrets next to the app manifests. In a helm context, Flux uses its secret generator to decrypt the secrets and pass them to the helm release.

Keys are off‑repo. The cluster only knows the age private key needed by Flux to decrypt.

## 07 Architecture diagram

Below is the map I keep in my head. Central services (Postgres, Redis, MinIO) are shared by design; Harbor is just the first consumer but each later component requiring them will connect to them and not run its separate service. **Ingress mainly fronts internal UIs** — Harbor, MinIO Console, Grafana, and VictoriaLogs.

[![Architecture diagram](/images/post-04/sonda-red-cluster-v3.png)](/images/post-04/sonda-red-cluster-v3.png)

## 08 Component overview

Entry path for the reconciler: [clusters/sonda-red/](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/tree/main/clusters/sonda-red)

> A note on observability:

My stack is intentionally simple. Full observability is a bit out of my scope, especially setting up alerting, etc. I have the basics down, as well as the default dashboards in Grafana, but I mainly stay in `Lens` to follow logs or deployment status while I'm working on the cluster.

###### Central services

I chose **central** Postgres, **central** Redis, and **central** MinIO as cluster services. Today only Harbor consumes them, but they’re **for the whole cluster**. That keeps state small in number of places and easy to back up. MinIO takes the largest chunk of storage from the 2 TB NVMe, as it's intended to be the S3 backend for most apps and I'll try to avoid persistent volumes when I can.

Harbor points to the shared services explicitly (values excerpt):

```diff
# harbor values
+ externalURL: https://harbor.sonda.red.local
+ database:
+   type: external
+   external:
+     host: postgres.postgres
+     username: harbor
+     coreDatabase: harbor
+ redis:
+   type: external
+   external:
+     addr: redis.redis:6379
```

Full manifests sit under [infrastructure/harbor/](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/tree/main/infrastructure/harbor). 

### k3s specifics

* **Upgrades:** System Upgrade Controller → [flux-system/system-upgrade-controller.yaml](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/blob/main/clusters/sonda-red/flux-system/system-upgrade-controller.yaml)

 k3s has a [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller), which is not built in but separately installed. It consists of an operator and a controller that watches for `Plan` resources and applies them to the nodes. The nodes are adequately drained, cordoned and upgraded. I use it to upgrade the k3s version from within the cluster, so I can just change the version in the `Plan` and it will apply it to all nodes, without having to run k3s scripts on the nodes manually.

 An upgrade `Plan` looks like this:

```yaml
# Server plan
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: server-plan
  namespace: system-upgrade
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  cordon: true
  nodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
      operator: In
      values:
      - "true"
  serviceAccountName: system-upgrade
  upgrade:
    image: rancher/k3s-upgrade
  version: v1.33.3-k3s1
  tolerations:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
      operator: Exists
      effect: NoSchedule
    - key: node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable
      operator: Exists
      effect: NoSchedule
---
# Agent plan
apiVersion: upgrade.cattle.io/v1
kind: Plan
metadata:
  name: agent-plan
  namespace: system-upgrade
spec:
  concurrency: 1
  cordon: true
  nodeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
    - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
      operator: DoesNotExist
  prepare:
    args:
    - prepare
    - server-plan
    image: rancher/k3s-upgrade
  serviceAccountName: system-upgrade
  upgrade:
    image: rancher/k3s-upgrade
  version: v1.33.3-k3s1
  tolerations:
    - key: dedicated
      operator: Equal
      value: gpu
      effect: PreferNoSchedule
    - key: node.kubernetes.io/unschedulable
      operator: Exists
      effect: NoSchedule
```

### Intel GPU specifics

* **Node inventory:** Node Feature Discovery → [infrastructure/nfd/](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/tree/main/infrastructure/nfd)
It detects the presence of Intel GPUs and labels them accordingly. GPU plugin’s node selector is used to deploy plugin to nodes which have such a GPU label.
* **Intel Device Operator:** Intel Device Operator → [infrastructure/intel-device-operator/](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/tree/main/infrastructure/intel-device-operator)
Intel Device Plugins Operator is a Kubernetes custom controller whose goal is to serve the installation and lifecycle management of Intel device plugins for Kubernetes. It provides a single point of control for GPU, QAT, SGX, FPGA, DSA and DLB devices to cluster administrators.
* **Intel GPU plugin:** Intel Device Plugin → [infrastructure/intel-device-plugins-gpu/](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/tree/main/infrastructure/intel-device-plugins-gpu)

As taken from the official docs: https://intel.github.io/intel-device-plugins-for-kubernetes/cmd/gpu_plugin/README.html

> Intel GPU plugin facilitates Kubernetes workload offloading by providing access to discrete (including Intel® Data Center GPU Flex & Max Series) and integrated Intel GPU devices supported by the host kernel.
>
> Use cases include, but are not limited to:
>
> - Media transcode
>
> - Media analytics
>
> - Cloud gaming
>
> - High performance computing
>
> - AI training and inference

Basically, it exposes the Intel GPUs to the cluster as resources, so you can request them in your pods. As soon as you install the plugin, the DaemonSet is created and the GPUs are advertised to the scheduler. A pod also spawns on each node that has the appropriate label, which prints:

```bash
I0817 13:01:11.792873       1 gpu_plugin.go:799] GPU device plugin started with none preferred allocation policy
I0817 13:01:11.793010       1 gpu_plugin.go:518] GPU (i915/xe) resource share count = 1
I0817 13:01:11.793909       1 gpu_plugin.go:540] GPU scan update: 0->2 'i915' resources found
I0817 13:01:11.793915       1 gpu_plugin.go:540] GPU scan update: 0->1 'i915_monitoring' resources found
I0817 13:01:12.794849       1 server.go:285] Start server for i915_monitoring at: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/gpu.intel.com-i915_monitoring.sock
I0817 13:01:12.794851       1 server.go:285] Start server for i915 at: /var/lib/kubelet/device-plugins/gpu.intel.com-i915.sock
I0817 13:01:12.797391       1 server.go:303] Device plugin for i915 registered
I0817 13:01:12.797394       1 server.go:303] Device plugin for i915_monitoring registered
I0817 13:01:13.629689       1 gpu_plugin.go:92] Select nonePolicy for GPU device allocation
I0817 13:01:13.629703       1 gpu_plugin.go:138] Allocate deviceIds: ["card0-0"]

```
This log shows the Intel GPU plugin found the two Arc GPUs, registered them with the kubelet, and now pods can request them by adding `resources.requests: { gpu.intel.com/i915: 1 }`. The monitoring resource is also available if you deploy the sidecar/telemetry components.

### Component updates

Wired Renovate so chart bumps show up as PRs I can merge (or ignore): [renovate.json](https://github.com/sonda-red/cluster-management/blob/main/renovate.json)

## 09 To-do and next steps

- [ ] Add bootstrap helmfile deployments to be managed by Flux
- [ ] Research and add Flux dashboards as quality of life improvement
- [ ] Begin building some containers with the `arc` runners and push them to Harbor
- [ ] VPN or some kind of public endpoint for remote access to the cluster

Hopefully, this is where the fun begins. I want to experiment a bit with scheduling and running different kinds of workloads. No real solid plan for the next article but I have a few ideas:

- Stable Diffusion
- LLMs and different inference engines like vllm, llama.cpp, etc.
- Explore model and prompt versioning
- Observability of Intel GPUs and their utilization
- Benchmarking and comparing different inference engines?
- Loading bigger models on both GPUs
